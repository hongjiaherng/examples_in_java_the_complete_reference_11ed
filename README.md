**Sample source codes for the book: Java The Complete Reference (11 ed.) by Herbert Schildt**

At the time of this writing, I discovered that the code examples in the book are not available for download at "www.OraclePressBooks.com" as it stated.
Thus, I'd decided to upload the code examples which I wrote when I was learning Core Java onto GitHub to more or less provide some help to the beginners out there! 
At the same time, I could pick up some basics on using git.

- The code examples don't comprise those before Chapter 8 Inheritance.
- Some files name are different from the examples in the book, yet it represents the same meaning.
